# Cirrus-Palindromes
An application that finds the largest palindrome number between two given numbers.

## Tasks
1. Find the largest palindromic number in between two numbers that are input by the user
2. Create a UI with the following components:
 1. Two input fields to allow the user to enter the lower and upper bounds for the search
 2. Search button
 3. Result area to show the result of the largest palindromic number found
3. Setup a Git repository using either BitBucket or GitHub and share with dkenney@cirrusled.com when the assignment is complete
 1. Please organize the repository logically, with multiple commits. I do not want to see one large commit at the end.
4. Create an executable JAR file of the application with instructions on how to run it


## How to Run
You should be able to run the PalindromeFinder.jar file just by double clicking it. The program works as expected and checks for multiple errors in the input. It should also be noted that the palindrome found is non inclusive of the two numbers given by the user.
